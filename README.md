# React-Portfolio App

Personal portfolio page [www.lukeketchen.com](www.lukeketchen.com) built in React.

# Building Process

## Design

I found a style that I would like to make the portfolio and I am looking in photoshop to see what colours go well together. These colours I will make into SCSS variables.

#### Colour template

**Background**

- **BG**- #242424 light grey
- **Post BG** - #151515 medium grey
- **SidebarBG** - #151515 dark grey

**Text colour**

- **Title text** - #c59a5b yellow
- **Subtext** - #7a7a7a Light greay

So I have picked my colours and think I’m going to go with a one-page design with the projects looking like blog posts vertically down the page. A timeline down the centre with each post branching off it. Now I have my design thought out its time to start.

## Create

I’m going to start with create react app and rip it down.
